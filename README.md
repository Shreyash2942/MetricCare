# 🏥 MetricCare – AWS Healthcare Data Lakehouse

**MetricCare** is a SaaS-based, multi-tenant **real-time analytics platform** for **CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services)** compliance and healthcare quality monitoring.  
It empowers hospitals to measure, benchmark, and improve clinical and operational performance through automated data pipelines and interactive dashboards.

---

## 📌 Project Purpose
MetricCare enables hospitals to track CMS compliance, improve patient satisfaction, and optimize performance.  
It supports data-driven decision-making with real-time KPIs and alerts — ensuring compliance readiness and reducing audit risks.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Regulatory Compliance** – Real-time CMS metric tracking (Mortality, Infection, Readmission, ALOS).  
- **Patient Satisfaction Insights** – Integrate Press Ganey survey data for quality correlation.  
- **Operational Efficiency** – Forecast and monitor ER wait times, bed occupancy, and staff workload.  
- **Benchmarking & Reporting** – Compare hospital performance against national and regional averages.  
- **User-Centric Design** – Role-based dashboards for administrators, clinicians, and compliance officers.

## 📊 Core CMS Metrics

| Metric | Derived From | FHIR Resources Used | Description |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Mortality Rate** | Condition.code = “Death” | Patient, Encounter, Condition | Measures in-hospital deaths per 100 discharges. |
| **Readmission Rate (30-Day)** | Encounter.period | Patient, Encounter | Tracks patients readmitted within 30 days. |
| **Infection Rate (HAI)** | Condition.onsetDateTime > 48h post-admission | Condition, Encounter | Hospital-acquired infection rate. |
| **Average Length of Stay (ALOS)** | Encounter.period.start–end | Encounter | Average days per admission. |

> CMS metrics are simulated using **FHIR-standard Patient, Encounter, and Condition** resources enriched with **SNOMED-CT codes**.

## 🧬 Data Pipeline Overview

1. **Synthetic Data Generation (FHIR)**  
   - Python + Faker generate Patient, Encounter, and Condition JSONs.  
   - Aligned with HL7 FHIR R4 and SNOMED CT codes for realism.  

2. **Data Lakehouse (S3 + Glue + Hudi + Athena)**  
   - **S3 Bronze** – Raw FHIR JSONs  
   - **S3 Silver** – Cleaned and normalized Hudi tables  
   - **S3 Gold** – Aggregated CMS metrics  

3. **ETL Orchestration**  
   - AWS **Glue Jobs & Workflows** handle transformations (Bronze → Silver → Gold).  
   - **Lambda** triggers workflows on new S3 events.  
   - **DynamoDB** tracks processed files (idempotent ingestion).  

4. **Automation & Monitoring**  
   - **EventBridge** schedules workflows; **SNS** sends job alerts.  
   - **CloudWatch** provides logs and metrics for observability.  

5. **Analytics Layer**  
   - **Athena** validates metrics through SQL queries.  
   - **Power BI** visualizes CMS metrics by department, year, and demographic.
